# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a Colombian System Engineer, cloud computing lover and enthusiast of DevSecOps culture.
I really love drink :coffee: while coding, this is kind of fuel to me.
I try to spend as much time as possible with my family, enjoy a lot play in the playground with my toddler son.
I like to watch casually some sports like Formula 1 and Soccer, I also like to watch the giro d italy and the tour of france, but I'm not an expert or a fanatic on those sports.
This is basically me, I'm not trying to impress some one or trying to look fancy or sophisticated, I just enjoy the life as it is.
